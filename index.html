        <p>I’m always up for trying a different version of a recipe. I absolutely love playing around with chocolate in my kitchen and I’ve tried a hundred different varitaions of chocolate brownies, gooey chocolate cakes, mug cakes etc. Nothing compares to this hot fudge cake. It is so warm, like a hug in a cake. A hybrid of a gooey brownie, cake with a lava in the middle- it doesn’t get better than this. It uses ingredients that are readily available in your kitchen and comes together really easily!</p>

        <p> This recipe is super quick. But just a few points to keep in mind so that you get all that beautiful gooeyness from the cake.</p>

        <ol type="1">
        	<li>While mixing the dry ingredients for the cake batter, if your cocoa powder is lumpy, you can sift it in instead of simply adding it. Sifting will help remove all the lumps and give a smooth batter.</li>
        	<li>While pouring over boiling water, make sure to not mix it in. let the water just sit and the cake will bake beautifully.</li>
			<li>When the cake is in the oven, check for the jiggly centre after 35 minutes of baking. If you think the cake is too liquidy from the centre, then you can bake it for an additional 10 minutes.</li>
			<li>If you want to enhance the chocolate flavor even more, you can add 1/4tsp of coffee powder into the boiling water and then bake this cake.</li>
			<li>This cake is best when served warm so try to make it as close to serving time as possible.</li>
